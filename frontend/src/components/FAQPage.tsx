        No. Genetic prevalence correlates but does not equate to disease

        disorder, irrespective of whether these individuals will or will not

      "Why is this calculator not suited for autosomal dominant and x-linked conditions?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        This method is designed for autosomal recessive disease because
        prevalence can be calculated by observing carriers at expected rates in
        the general population, i.e., using the carrier frequency in unaffected
        individuals. In contrast, for dominant disorders, pathogenic variants
        are typically found in affected individuals who are less likely to
        participate in or meet recruitment criteria for research studies that
        are included in reference population databases. As a result, this method
        does not work as well for many autosomal dominant conditions. For
        X-linked disorders in carrier females, the mild manifestation of disease
        could have similar effects as dominant disorders. We are working on
        creating methods and tools for estimating genetic prevalence of AD and
        XL diseases and hope to add them in future versions. This method is
        designed for autosomal recessive disease. Individuals with rare disease
        are less likely to participate in or meet recruitment criteria for
        research studies that are included in reference population databases, so
        this method does not work for autosomal dominant or X-linked conditions.
        For the same reason, the depletion of symptomatic carriers could lower
        the allele frequencies of pathogenic variants observed in gnomAD. We are
        working on creating methods and tools for estimating genetic prevalence
        of AD and XL diseases and hope to add them in future versions.

    answer: (
      <Text>
        Since we use gnomAD as our reference database for allele frequencies we
        can only include variants that have been seen in 1 or more individuals
        in gnomAD. If a variant is absent from gnomAD, it will not be listed in
        your report, but that doesnât not mean it is not pathogenic. It means
        that the variant is either low frequency, it is not well covered by
        exome and/or genome sequencing, or is present in a population not well
        represented in gnomAD. The variant could be in future versions of
        gnomAD, which is why we recommend reassessing these frequencies after
        new gnomAD releases.

          This tool provides an estimated carrier frequency and genetic
          prevalence. There are many factors that go into these estimates, which
          can influence the way you interpret the results.

        <Text mb={2}>
          Disease spectrum is an important part of interpreting genetic
          prevalence. The following factors should always be considered:

            <strong>Symptomatic carriers:</strong> We use gnomAD as our source
            of allele frequencies for GeniE. Individuals with rare disease are
            less likely to participate in or meet recruitment criteria for
            research studies that are included in reference population
            databases. Depletion of symptomatic carriers could lower the allele
            frequencies of pathogenic variants observed in gnomAD.

            <strong>Impacts to life expectancy:</strong> Genetic prevalence
            represents the estimated proportion of a population that has a
            causal genotype for a genetic disorder, however it does not account
            for the possibility that specific allele combinations may lead to
            early misscarriage or neonatal loss. Some combinations could lead to
            loss of life early on, before the individual could be identified as
            having the clinical diagnosis.

            <strong>Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity:</strong>{" "}
            Similarly, the full phenotypic spectrum is still being discovered
            for many diseases. This final estimate does not currently take into
            consideration whether everyone with a casual genotype would present
            with the phenotype/disease of interest.

        <Text mb={2}>
          While genetic prevalence is an important part of answering, âHow many
          people are there with X disease?â, additional methods of estimating
          incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk should also be assessed when
          available. If these various methods are returning vastly different
          results some additional questions should be asked about the genetic
          prevalence estimates.

            Variants in gnomAD have been identified via exome or genome
            sequencing. Variants not detectable by one for these two
            technologies will not be included in these estimates. Additionally,
            if a significant portion of patients with a clinical diagnosis are
            still missing a molecular diagnosis, that would mean that the full
            variant spectrum is not totally understood and would also lead to a
            lower estimated genetic prevalence.

          <ListItem>
            <em>Is the disease-gene relationship still relatively new?</em> It
            can take years to appreciate the full variant spectrums for a novel
            disease. During that time there can be fewer pathogenic variants
            known for a disease, which limits the number of allele frequencies
            included in the calculations. This can lead to lower than expected
            frequency information. One of the benefits of this tool is we will
            enable users to redo the calculations over time including more
            variants as they are collected.

            Even a single high frequency allele can dramatically impact the

            mentioned above, disease spectrum should always be considered in
            interpreting these results. Impacts to life expectancy, reduced
            penetrance and variable expressivity can all lead to estimated
            genetic prevalence being considerably higher than estimates based on
            a clinical diagnosis alone. Additionally, does the disease have any
            phenocopies, either caused by another gene that could lead to
            individuals being diagnostically grouped in with some more common,

            Allele frequencies are determined by allele count/allele number.

            inflate the frequencies. Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence

            allele frequencies when there are more than 2,000 reference alleles

    answer: (
      <Text>
        While you can upload variants from multiple genes using GeniE's custom
        variant list, the model for genetic prevalence will assume digenic
        inheritance, rather than giving you the sum of each of the individual
        genes. We are working towards having functionality that allows you to
        create a meta report for multiple gene estimates, but for now we
        recommend calculating each gene separately and then adding the estimates
        together.

    title: "How to handle reduced penetrance variants?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <Text>
          Some variants can be pathogenic yet have much reduced penetrance
          compared to other variants in the gene. For recessive diseases, these
          are often hypomorphic alleles where they have partial activity. For
          example, some splice variants only lead to partial splice disruption
          and the transcript is still expressed at a reduced level. Others may
          be a missense variant that reduces enzyme activity but still leaves
          the protein largely intact. For many of these variants, they may only
          cause disease if combined with a second allele that is fully
          pathogenic but not when the hypomorphic allele is homozygous.
          Therefore, one may wish to exclude them from the calculation if the
          disease that is manifest is too divergent from the primary disease or
          in order to exclude the effects of the homozygous state. Alternatively
          one can include these alleles and then subtract the homozygous
          frequency of the reduced penetrant allele(s) from the final
          calculation.
