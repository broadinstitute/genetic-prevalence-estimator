            No. Genetic prevalence correlates but does not equate to disease prevalence (PMID: 34078906). Genetic prevalence refers to the proportion of a population that has a causal genotype for a specific genetic disorder, irrespective of whether these individuals will or will not manifest the disease. For instance, if the causative genotype is not fully penetrant, then the estimated genetic prevalence will be higher than actual disease prevalence. To learn more about the factors that shape the estimated genetic prevalence, please read

              Remove gnomAD homozygotes:

             This version of the formula will subtract the homozygous counts for any variant in the list that has homozygotes in gnomAD before performing the calculations via the formula:

          </p>
          This approach might be taken if there is concern that homozygous variants seen in the general population as represented by gnomAD may not be pathogenic. For some recessive conditions, there are hypomorphic or mild variants that can cause disease when in trans to a more severe variant but do not cause disease in the homozygous state.

             This option shows you the sum total of the allele counts for all variants included over the average allele number (AN) for all variants included within that ancestry group. Note: the AN can vary for each variant due to differences in coverage across regions of a gene and/or limitations of exomes.

            For both carrier frequency and genetic prevalence the user is given a variety of options for displaying the reuslts, including fraction and scientific notation.

            This method is designed for autosomal recessive disease because prevalence can be calculated by observing carriers at expected rates in the general population, i.e., using the carrier frequency in unaffected individuals. In contrast, for dominant disorders, pathogenic variants are typically found in affected individuals who are less likely to participate in or meet recruitment criteria for research studies that are included in reference population databases. As a result, this method does not work as well for many autosomal dominant conditions. For X-linked disorders in carrier females, the mild manifestation of disease could have similar effects as dominant disorders. We are working on creating methods and tools for estimating genetic prevalence of AD and XL diseases and hope to add them in future versions. This method is designed for autosomal recessive disease. Individuals with rare disease are less likely to participate in or meet recruitment criteria for research studies that are included in reference population databases, so this method does not work for autosomal dominant or X-linked conditions. For the same reason, the depletion of symptomatic carriers could lower the allele frequencies of pathogenic variants observed in gnomAD. We are working on creating methods and tools for estimating genetic prevalence of AD and XL diseases and hope to add them in future versions.

            In gnomAD v4.1.0, allele numbers are calculated across all callable sites in the gnomAD exomes and genomes. This allows us to combine exome and genome allele numbers at all sites with gnomAD variation, improving the accuracy of the allele frequency estimtes. In gnomAD v2.1.1 this method was not used, meaning that allele frequencies could look higher than they truly were. An example of this is if a variant was identified in one genome sample in v2, the allele frequency was reported as ~1/32,000 (0.00003) despite there being sufficient coverage in the exomes to show the variant was absent from the other ~220,000 alelles, and thus has a frequency closer to 1/250,000 (0.000004)

            Since we use gnomAD as our reference database for allele frequencies we can only include variants that have been seen in 1 or more individuals in gnomAD. If a variant is absent from gnomAD, it will not be listed in your report, but that doesnât not mean it is not pathogenic. It means that the variant is either low frequency, it is not well covered by exome and/or genome sequencing, or is present in a population not well represented in gnomAD. The variant could be in future versions of gnomAD, which is why we recommend reassessing these frequencies after new gnomAD releases.

               We use gnomAD as our source of allele frequencies for GeniE.

               Genetic prevalence represents the estimated proportion of a population that has a causal genotype for a genetic disorder, however it does not account for the possibility that specific allele combinations may lead to early misscarriage or neonatal loss. Some combinations could lead to loss of life early on, before the individual could be identified as having the clinical diagnosis.

                What proportion of affected individuals have disease-causing variants detectable by exome or genome sequencing?
              </em>
               Variants in gnomAD have been identified via exome or genome sequencing. Variants not detectable by one for these two technologies will not be included in these estimates. Additionally, if a significant portion of patients with a clinical diagnosis are still missing a molecular diagnosis, that would mean that the full variant spectrum is not totally understood and would also lead to a lower estimated genetic prevalence.

               It can take years to appreciate the full variant spectrums for a novel disease. During that time there can be fewer pathogenic variants known for a disease, which limits the number of allele frequencies included in the calculations. This can lead to lower than expected frequency information. One of the benefits of this tool is we will enable users to redo the calculations over time including more variants as they are collected.

               Even a single high frequency allele can dramatically impact the results so we recommend reviewing any high frequency variants to determine if they have a well established association with disease. You can unselect a variant to review the results without that allele included.

               As mentioned above, disease spectrum should always be considered in interpreting these results. Impacts to life expectancy, reduced penetrance and variable expressivity can all lead to estimated genetic prevalence being considerably higher than estimates based on a clinical diagnosis alone. Additionally, does the disease have any phenocopies, either caused by another gene that could lead to individuals being diagnostically grouped in with some more common, non-specific phenotype like autism or cerebral palsy?

            </a>
             is a database of aggregated exome and genome sequencing data contributed by a coalition of investigators. This database does not include individuals recruited for severe pediatric disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis and autism) as well as their first-degree relatives, allowing the database to largely represent the general population, making it ideal for our estimates.

            While you can upload variants from multiple genes using GeniE's custom variant list, the model for genetic prevalence will assume digenic inheritance, rather than giving you the sum of each of the individual genes. We are working towards having functionality that allows you to create a meta report for multiple gene estimates, but for now we recommend calculating each gene separately and then adding the estimates together.

            Some variants can be pathogenic yet have much reduced penetrance compared to other variants in the gene. For recessive diseases, these are often hypomorphic alleles where they have partial activity. For example, some splice variants only lead to partial splice disruption and the transcript is still expressed at a reduced level. Others may be a missense variant that reduces enzyme activity but still leaves the protein largely intact. For many of these variants, they may only cause disease if combined with a second allele that is fully pathogenic but not when the hypomorphic allele is homozygous. Therefore, one may wish to exclude them from the calculation if the disease that is manifest is too divergent from the primary disease or in order to exclude the effects of the homozygous state. Alternatively one can include these alleles and then subtract the homozygous frequency of the reduced penetrant allele(s) from the final calculation.
