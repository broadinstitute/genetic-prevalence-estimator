# Genetic Prevalence Estimator, GeniE

The prevalence GeniE tool aims to estimate carrier frequency and genetic prevalence for recessive conditions using allele frequencies from population data in gnomAD. We provide support for creating variant lists from ClinVar and gnomAD, or allow users to build their own custom list using gnomAD IDs.
